# tincan-interpreter-refactor
This is a refactor of an interpreter for the esolang tincan (https://esolangs.org/wiki/TinCan)

The original interpreter was written by the reddit user u/dehodson who asked for a code review (https://www.reddit.com/r/haskellquestions/comments/8kv6fu/code_review/dzc5h0e/?context=3)

The code in this repository is the relization of my suggestions.
